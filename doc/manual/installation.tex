\chapter{Installation Instructions}
\label{chap:installation}
\section{Requirements}

The MCAPL software requires Java 7.  

\begin{sloppypar}
Unfortunately Java 7 is incompatible with the leJOS software for Lego Mindstorms NXT robots.  As such support for Lego Robots is absent from this version.  However the Lego Rover code is available both in the git source repository and as part of the LegoRoverNW project on github (\texttt{http://github.com/legorovers/LegoRoverNW}).
\end{sloppypar}

\section{Installation}\index{installation}

\begin{itemize}
\begin{sloppypar}
\item Download ajpf2014.tar.gz from source forge \texttt{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcapl/files/mcapl/}.
\end{sloppypar}
\item Create a file \texttt{.jpf/site.properties} with the path to ajpf2014 assigned to the value \texttt{mcapl} (e.g. \texttt{mcapl = \$\{user.home\}/Eclipse/ajpf2014}).
\item Within the ajpf2014 directory you should find \texttt{build.xml} to which you can apply ant to build ajpf. (e.g., at the command line, ant compile to just compile the files and ant build to build and run regression tests (takes just over two minutes on a 2.8GHz MacBook with 8 GB memory))
\item Make sure you have the bin sub-directory of ajpf\_v0.1 on your java class path.
\item We recommend you set the \texttt{AJPF\_HOME}\index{AJPF\_HOME} environment variable to give the path to your ajpf directory.
\end{itemize}

\section{Eclipse Installation}\index{installation!Eclipse}

We also supply an eclipse \texttt{.project} file so you should be able to import ajpf2014 simply into eclipse.
\begin{itemize}
\item You should then be able to build ajpf by clicking on the 'build.xml file.
\item Create a file \texttt{.jpf/site.properties} with the path to ajpf2014 assigned to the value \texttt{mcapl} (e.g. \texttt{mcapl = \$\{user.home\}/Eclipse/ajpf2014}).
\item We recommend you set the \texttt{AJPF\_HOME} environment variable to give the path to your ajpf directory.  If necessary you can do this within the Environment tab for individual Run Configurations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing the Installation}

There are a number of JUnit tests in the subdirectory \texttt{/src/tests} and examples in \texttt{/src/examples}.\index{tests}
